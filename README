                  NoZone Readme
                  =============

NoZone is a tool for simplifying the management of Bind DNS
Zone files, by eliminating the need to write them directly.
NoZone defines a simple, structured configuration file, from
which Bind DNS zone files are generated. For cases where there
are many domains sharing the same basic DNS records, it will
greatly reduce the duplication of information. Use of a higher
level configuration format, protects the administrator from
many of the potential pitfalls inherent in the archaic Bind
zone format.

NoZone is free software distributed under the terms of the
GNU GPL license, version 3 or later.
