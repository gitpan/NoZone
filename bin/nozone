=head1 NAME

nozone - a Bind DNS zone file generator

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 nozone [OPTION]...

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<nozone> will read a description of required DNS zones from the
configuration file C</etc/nozone.cfg>. It will then generate a
set of Bind DNS zone files.

=head1 OPTIONS

Valid command line options are

=over 4

=item -c CONFIGFILE, --config=CONFIGFILE

Specify a different configuration file from the default (C</etc/nozone.cfg>)

=item --datadir DIR

Specify a different directory for bind zone data files from the
default (C</var/named/data>)

=item --confdir DIR

Specify a different directory for bind zone conf files from the
default (C</etc/named>)

=item --master IPADDR

Specify the IP address of the master DNS server. If set this causes
generation of a slave zone config, and no zone data files. This can
be repeated multiple times.

=item -v, --verbose

Print details about each file generated

=item -h, --help

Print this help message
